Small android app I wrote to track my own VW van

The app runs as a service, it tracks the GPS speed. It sends a text message when the phone starts moving at > 5km/h
It sends another text message when the phone has stopped moving.
If you call from a specific number, the phone texts back the current speed/location.

The UI is the default app made by Android Studio and values are hardcoded. 
But it's probably a decent reference for someone who'd want to do a similar thing!
